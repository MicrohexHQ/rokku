# Proxy mode decision document

* Status: Initial draft
* Deciders: Niels Denissen, Adam Rempter, Krzysztof Å»mij, Andrew Snare

## Context and Problem Statement

Proxy mode decision determines and impacts next functionality that will be implemented on both STS 
and Proxy services.

## Considered options

### Option 1: Passthrough (with ACL manager)

In this solution a separate process will periodically translate Ranger policies to S3 ACLs. This way authorisation and
validation of requests can be done by CEPH itself. Authentication of the short lived token goes through the STS service.

**The Good**
* Request processing at proxy is simpler, just token verification
* Original request is sent unmodified
* Security is done per user

**The Bad**
* All users must exist in S3 Backend (Ceph in this case)
* All bucket permissions must be defined in S3 Backend (Ceph in this case)
* It may lead to unwanted access in case of ACL manager failure and consistency issues
* Auditing cannot be done by Ranger easily, we'd have to write our own audit logging
* Any update on Ceph might require change to the ACL manager

### Option 2: Passthrough (with system users on Ceph)
![alt text](./img/option_2:_Passthrough.png)

This solution directly connects to Ranger to authorise requests when they come in. Users have their own 
access/secret keys and these also exist on CEPH (or are created if not present yet). They are present as system users
though that can access all resources. This way we can passthrough any request after checking authentication of the token
with STS and authorisation with Ranger. Validation of the request thus happens in Ceph since we don't touch the request
itself.

**The Good**
* Original request is sent unmodified (no need to resign or validate at proxy)
* Ceph will also contain bucket owners/object creators information

**The Bad**
* User needs to be created on Ceph
* access/secretkey pair need to be handed to user / created on Ceph and managed in case they're lost (could be done by STS though)

### Option 3: NPA
![alt text](./img/option_3:_NPA.png)

In this solution authorisation happens with Ranger and Authentication of the token with STS. The original user request 
is validated based on AWS Signature headers so validation happens inside the gargoyle proxy. 
On success a new request is created and sent by proxy to S3 Backend (thus the request is resigned).In this case user 
request is terminated at Proxy and NPA (non personal account) is used by Proxy to prepare and send all requests to 
backend. 

**The Good**
* Particular users do not need to be maintained on Ceph
* It simplifies STS logic and consistency interactions between services 

**The Bad**
* Additional logic has to be created on Proxy to handle resignature process and user
response (eg. list buckets)
* All Ceph permissions are done with use of one NPA account, although security definitions
are also maintained by STS (and related components)


## Decision outcome

**Choose Option 2 - Passthrough (with system users on Ceph)**

- Sync issues of ACL manager might lead to unwanted access which we deem a big problem.
- NPA requires resigning which forces us to support many signature types of s3 that might change in the future.
So this could imply maintenance or unforeseen problems with new signature types.
- We'll have an overview of who created/modified what files in Ceph as well. Basically we'll use Ceph as intended and only
take away the authorisation and authentication part towards Gargoyle.
